        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>It is our privilege to participate in this
global network, reminding us that we are all neighbors now. Our aim is to
facilitate win/win situations for all participants of a real estate transaction, and,
thankfully, we are successful in this aim.</p>
        
        <h1>Company History</h1>
        <p>In 1986, the year of Houston's sesquicentennial, Allen Brothers, REALTORS came into existence.  In 1836 the Allen brothers founded Houston.  The Allen brothers were Houston's original real estate brokers.</p>

   <p>In 1988 we moved our office to its present location, 1828 Bissonnet at Woodhead, just north of Rice University in the museum area of Houston, Texas. Our company  takes full advantage of the latest technology.  We view our work in real estate, serving our customers, as an opportunity to express the highest and best that is in us. Our company  places great importance on responding to our clients, making each transaction unique, since individual clients require different amounts of information and education depending on their real estate histories.</p>

<p>Areas of expertise include residential and commercial real estate.  David Bryan, CCIM, CPM offers individuals the opportunity to join others in purchasing  professionally managed real estate, with limited liability, often outperforming many other kinds of investments with the potential for major appreciation.</p>
